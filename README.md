# Heatmap Intuition

This repository is a collection of visually intuitive, physics-driven projects that explore the power of **heatmaps** for scientific and mathematical analysis. Each project combines mathematical rigor, Python code, and visual storytelling to reveal patterns, fields, and structures that might otherwise remain abstract.

## Overview

Understanding complex mathematical and physical phenomena often requires more than just formulas — it demands **visual intuition**. This repository brings that intuition to life through **heatmaps**, enabling interpretation of concepts like vector operations and electromagnetic fields.

Currently Included Projects:

1. **Dot Product Heatmap** – Visualizing the dot product normalised vectors with themselves on a 2D plane.
2. **Magnetic Field of a Finite Solenoid** – Mapping the magnitude of the magnetic field in and around a finite-length solenoid.

Each project includes:

- A **heatmap visualization**
- Underlying **math and physics**
- **Interpretation of results**
- Clean, well-commented **Python code**
